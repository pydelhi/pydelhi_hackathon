# Logo Detection folder
This project folder can be directly used with the Kivy App on Mac to run it locally. User can click the photo from the laptop web cam and internally code will fetch the Logos details from the Google Cloud Vision API. User need to update the creds.json file with their Vision API credentials details, which one can download from the GCP console easily.
